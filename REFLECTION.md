# Module 1 Assignment: Personal Resume

## 1. Can I explain what my code does?
 
My code contains Resume webpage which is built with HTML5. It includes following sections:

- Header: which contains my name and navigation menu along with links to some sections.
- About Me: gives an introduction and provides contact information, link for GitHub.
- Skills: provides my skills.
- Experience: contains my experience as a cook at a restaurant.
- Education: provides my current diploma along with college.
- Strengths: lists personal strengths.

I used different semantic elements in this code like <section>, <header>, <img> and so on to make content meaningfully.

## What was my coding process?
- Firstly I analysed all the instructions given in Learn website. And after that i decided what to write under sections. This helps me keep organised.
- I use git bash to commit as i am familiar with it which makes it easier for me to do commits and i make small and meaningfull commits for each major change.

## What challenges did I have?
- Thinking about proper reasonable headings was bit challenging for me. I solved this by cheking online resumes.
- Errors after running W3C validation was also problematic. But i tackle it by carefully reviewing the code and error message.

## What would I do differently now?
- I added <footer> section with link and contact information.
- I might include one more section for Strengths to make resume more valuable.
